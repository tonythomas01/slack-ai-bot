# Ask AI Slack Bot ü§ñ

This is a Flask-based Slack bot that integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4 to provide AI-generated responses to Slack thread discussions. Users can invoke the bot through a message shortcut, enter a query, and receive AI-powered insights based on the thread's context.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Secure Slack request verification to prevent unauthorized access.
- Interactive Slack modal to capture user queries.
- Fetches and processes Slack thread messages for better AI context.
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate AI responses.
- Posts ephemeral responses in the Slack thread for privacy.
- Asynchronous AI processing to prevent timeout issues.
- Error handling and user notifications in case of failures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- A Slack App with permissions:
  - `chat:write`
  - `chat:write.public`
  - `conversations.history`
  - `conversations.replies`
  - `commands`
- OpenAI API Key

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tonythomas01/slack-ai-bot.git
cd ask-ai-slack-bot
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file and add the following:
```
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your_slack_signing_secret
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your_slack_bot_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```
Or export them in your terminal:
```bash
export SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your_slack_signing_secret
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your_slack_bot_token

## üõ†Ô∏è Deploying to Production

For production, you can deploy this bot using **Google Cloud Run**, **AWS Lambda**, or **Docker**.

### Deploy with Docker
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t ask-ai-slack-bot .
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env ask-ai-slack-bot
   ```

---

## üìù How It Works
1. A user invokes the Slack bot using a **message shortcut**.
2. The bot opens a modal where the user enters a query.
3. The bot fetches the **entire Slack thread** where the shortcut was used.
4. The thread's context is sent to **OpenAI's GPT-4**.
5. The AI generates a response based on the conversation.
6. The bot posts an **ephemeral** AI response in the same thread.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling
- If the bot is not invited to a channel, users receive a prompt to invite it.
- If OpenAI API fails, users receive a message to retry later.
- If Slack API calls fail, errors are logged, and users are notified.

- **OAuth Scopes**:

   - `mpim:history`
   - `groups:history`
